                    French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s 2008 proposal for a Mediterranean Union connected with a high-speed rail link prompted our 
                    speculative urban project for Beirut – Extending Beirut: Imperfect Difference & Incomplete Repetition. <br><br>
            
                    The scheme recognises the pitfalls of recent major development in the Middle East: The repetition of traditional fabric 
                    results in a model which is homogeneous and inflexible (exemplified by the redeveloped Beirut Central District), while the 
                    extreme individuality of high rise towers in Dubai results in no difference at all. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>The research question became:  How can we leverage off the transformations wrought by high speed rail infrastructure to provide 
                    alternative models of large scale urban redevelopment that are spatially diversified, heterogeneous and yet still cohesive?</b> <br><br>
            
                    With this ambition, we developed a system of differentiated neighborhoods, where mini-towers types group and nest in clusters.  
                    The clusters of larger types clearly group around the different transport nodes forming shaded public interiors at the ground level. 
                    Also visible are the distinct typological families that nest around each of the transport nodes. <br><br>
            
                    The high-density  building fabric extends out from the existing city edge where it intersects with a modulated surface which 
                    deforms to accommodate the infrastructure network’s requirements. <br><br>
            
                    Angled towers which lean together in groups were deployed around the train station. Their connections allowed for shared 
                    structural systems, shared sky lobbies and a spatially diverse internal break up to suit multiple and varying tenancies.
