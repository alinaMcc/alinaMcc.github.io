                        Alina engages with the practice of architecture and urban design in an open and collaborative way. 
                        Alina approaches her work with curiosity and relishes problem-solving and learning. 
                        Currently broadening her skill-set through further study in the field of Software Engineering, 
                        Alina is positioned to contribute in the fields of both design and tech, or the intersection thereof.

                        Alina has completed a Masters of Architecture from The University of Technology, Sydney. She has also 
                        worked as a researcher and educator in Architecture and Urban Design Programs at the Architectural 
                        Association, the Bartlett School of Architecture and The University of Technology, Sydney. Her research 
                        has investigated conditions of urbanism and typology through the use of digital technology. Her recent 
                        work in practice has focused on collective housing within the urban context. She also holds a Bachelor of 
                        Design from The University of Sydney.

                        housing, education, commercial and mixed-use projects. She has worked on large-scale, multi-disciplinary
                        and complex projects across the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand with an expertise at working 
                        across scales in both urban design and architecture. She brings a broad perspective on urban challenges, 
                        emerging technologies, governance models and policy. Alina has worked in practice in London for

                        With a strong interest in computation and technology, her last role involved championing Building 
                        Information Modelling (BIM) processes and standards. Alina regularly works with scripting and visual 
                        programming to restructure how architectural practices can work internally on projects and deliver 
                        services to clients. Building on this interest, Alina has recently taken a career break to undertake 
                        learning in the field of software engineering developing skills in languages and frameworks including 
                        Python, Django, SQL. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
